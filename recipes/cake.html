    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>12 medium ripe plums, halved and pitted</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons cinnamon sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10-inch
        springform pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer
        until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, and beat well after each
        addition. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl and
        sift on top of the butter mixture; mix to combine. Transfer batter into
        the prepared springform pan and smooth out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set plums inside batter, cut-side up, and sprinkle evenly with
        cinnamon-sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven on the lowest rack until a toothpick inserted
        into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Serve warm or cool to
        room temperature.
